A collection of React components to build the dashboard interface with the WordPress classic Admin UI styles.

## Why?

One issue with many plugins and themes is that they create their own user interface and experience that do not align with the WordPress Admin styles. [Although there is an ongoing effort to update the WordPress Admin UI](https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plans-ambitious-admin-ui-revamp-with-design-system-galvanizing-broad-support-from-the-developer-community), the classic editor is still widely and may still be used in the WordPress ecosystem for the next coming years. This library provides a collection of components that can be utilized to build the dashboard interface with the classic styles.
